# SEO Site Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to optimize the efficiency of the pre-existing code as well as the accessibility when visiting Horiseon's page. The refactoring includes the addition of semantic elements to optimize the search engine experience.

As the Style of the website was requested to NOT be changed, the overall design of the page was not touched. However, the underlying code was structured to be more efficient and optimized.

### Updates

- Descriptive Title added for web page.
- HTML elements were edited to be semantic HTML elements
- Alt attributes added onto images
- CSS class element consolidation
- CSS Structure Organization
  - All style elements in CSS were grouped for better organization.
  - Comments added for better recogniztion of new element start.

## Installation

To install my assignment, I pushed the necessary files to the repository I had created on GitHub.

The following files were pushed:

- index.html
- assets folder
  - Style.css
  - All images used on web page
- README.md

The deployed link was created prior to committing anything additional to uploading initial files.

## Usage

When the deployed link is opened, you will be guided to a simple web page. Though the site is yet to be mobile friendly, that is a plan to look forward into the future.

You will be able to click on the navigation bar on the top right to land on the section within the webpage.

## Credits

Though worked on by myself, I would not be able to have completed this without the guidance of the teaching staff.
The lecturer, TA, and my classmates were a huge help.

GitHub Docs was a huge help in finding out how to upload screenshots and files to readme files.
